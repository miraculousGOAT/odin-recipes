        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                French fries, chips, finger chips, french-fried potatoes, 
                or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried 
                potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium or France. They 
                are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, 
                and frying them, usually in a deep fryer.
